1. At present, I am a front-end development engineer.
2. I want to participate in open source projects and improve rust skills.
3. First of all, learning by myself will cause a lot of confusion. Secondly, if I am lucky to be led by a mentor, I believe I will grow faster.
4. Because of my hobbies and interests, I devote myself to the computer industry and am determined to become an excellent developer. At present, the front-end development skills I master are self-taught. I want to participate in open source projects and improve my ability. I think my learning ability is good. I hope to have the opportunity to exercise myself.
