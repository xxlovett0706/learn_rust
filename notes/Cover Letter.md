Dear Mr. Yuan

I learned about liux foundation and CNCF - wasmedge through sharing on other websites, and then I learned about the mentor program.

I may not have much experience in wasm and have not mastered many related skills, but I have my own way to learn rust related grammar.

I hope I can improve my rust and wasm skills from the experience of this mentoring program and prepare for more open source projects in the future. I hope I can have the opportunity to participate.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Wei Xu
